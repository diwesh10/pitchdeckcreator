# AutoPitch Pro: Project Report

## 1. Introduction

AutoPitch Pro is a web-based tool designed to help entrepreneurs and innovators quickly transform a single-line startup idea into a structured, professional pitch deck. The application leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the core content for a 10-slide presentation, which is then delivered to the user as a downloadable PowerPoint (`.pptx`) file.

The primary goal of this project is to streamline the initial and often time-consuming phase of creating a pitch, allowing users to focus on refining their ideas rather than starting from scratch.

## 2. Features

- **Automated Content Generation:** The core of the application is its ability to take a simple idea and generate a complete 10-slide pitch deck, including slides for the problem, solution, market size, and more.
- **PowerPoint Export:** The generated pitch is automatically formatted into a standard PowerPoint file, ready for immediate use and further customization.
- **Web-Based Interface:** The application is built with Streamlit, providing a clean, user-friendly, and responsive interface that works in any modern web browser.
- **Secure API Key Management:** User API keys are handled securely using Streamlit's secrets management, ensuring they are not exposed on the frontend or in the codebase.
- **One-Click Deployment:** The project is configured for easy deployment on Streamlit Cloud, allowing it to be shared and used by a wider audience.

## 3. Technical Architecture

The application is built on a simple yet powerful stack of modern, open-source technologies.

-   **Frontend:** The user interface is built entirely in Python using the **Streamlit** framework. This allows for rapid development of interactive web applications without the need for traditional frontend languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
-   **Backend AI:** The pitch deck content is generated by **Google's Gemini model** (specifically, `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`). The application communicates with the Gemini API to send a structured prompt and receive the generated text for each slide.
-   **Presentation Generation:** The `.pptx` files are created using the **`python-pptx`** library. This library allows for the programmatic creation and manipulation of PowerPoint files, making it possible to translate the AI-generated text into a structured presentation.

## 4. How It Works

1.  The user enters their startup idea into the text input field on the web interface.
2.  When the "Generate Pitch" button is clicked, the application sends the user's idea to the Gemini API as part of a carefully crafted prompt.
3.  The Gemini model processes the prompt and returns the content for a 10-slide pitch deck, formatted as plain text.
4.  The application parses this text and uses the `python-pptx` library to create a new PowerPoint presentation, populating the title and content for each slide.
5.  The final `.pptx` file is then made available to the user for download through the Streamlit interface.

## 5. Setup and Deployment

The project is designed to be easy to set up both locally and for deployment.

-   **Local Setup:** The `README.md` file provides detailed instructions for cloning the repository, installing the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and configuring the local secrets file with a Google API key.
-   **Deployment:** A "Deploy to Streamlit" button in the `README.md` allows for one-click deployment to Streamlit Cloud. The only post-deployment step required is to add the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to the secrets manager in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard.

## 6. Conclusion

AutoPitch Pro serves as a powerful demonstration of how modern AI models and open-source tools can be combined to create practical and valuable applications. By automating the initial steps of pitch deck creation, it provides a tangible benefit to its users, saving them time and effort.

Future improvements could include offering different presentation templates, integrating with other free services for voiceover and video generation, or allowing users to customize the number and type of slides in their pitch deck.
